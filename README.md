# MySQL in MS-Excel VBA
## Developed by Pranav Nadimpalli, IIT Madras

Thank you for your time! I’m Pranav Nadimpalli, final year undergraduate student at IIT
Madras.

This is a passion project of mine: to test if MySQL queries can be run through Excel
VBA scripts and generate each query in an independent sheet.

I have sourced the input database from here:
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_op_in

**Steps to execute** ​:
● Enable ​Developer​ options in MS-Excel through ​Preferences
● Go to ​Developer > Macros > Select “Launch_ExcelSQL_Form” >
Run
● In the GUI that pops up, enter any SQL query or double-click an example query
from the ​“From Past Queries”​ menu
● Don’t forget to give the query a name! Type into the ​“Query Name”​ text box
● Click ​“Query”​ to execute the SQL query in MS-Excel

### It’s a Work in Progress. Here’s a snapshot of the Latest Version:
